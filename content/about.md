Hi. I'm Moiz Bootwala.

I work in offensive security — focused on red and purple teaming.

This site is where I document key learnings and share writeups from CTF challenges I solve. I also build tools — sometimes to fill gaps I notice, sometimes just to learn and experiment. 

You'll find those here:
- [GitHub](https://github.com/RIZZZIOM) → Tools I've built
- [/writeups/](/writeups/) → CTF writeups
- [/blog/](/blog/) → Research notes

Outside of security, I like working out, cars, bikes, music, and of course — coffee.

Reach out → [Email](mailto:rizzziom@gmail.com) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moiz-bootwala/)

See you around ╰•‿•╯
